<p>Welcome to the directory for Chimps in Space.</p>
<h2>Servers:</h2>
<p>Server IPs coming soon. Check back here later.</p>
<h2>Rules:</h2>
<p>By playing on Chimps in Space you agree to these rules. Ignorance is not an excuse to break these rules.</p>
<h3>1. Don't be an obnoxious edgelord.</h3>
<p>Act like an adult. I'm not running this server as a daycare. </p>
<h3>2. No exploits.</h3>
<p>Unintended spots on the map are OK provided you can be just as easily killed in that spot (ex. Under the map glitches are not OK.) This includes boosting on our servers.</p>
<h3>3. No hacks, scripts, or modified clients.</h3>
<p>This is obvious.</p>
<h3>4. Behave in the chat.</h3>
<p>This includes voice and text chat. If your presence in the chat is purely annoying,  you will get bonked. If all you do is complain about stuff in the chat, you will get bonked. </p>
<h3>5. Rule lawyers will be bonked.</h3>
<p>You are connected to our server. You will follow our rules. Don't come here trying to play lawyer and loophole your way around them.</p>
<h3>6. This list is not exhaustive.</h3>
<p>If it's not on this list, that doesn't mean it's fair game.</p>
